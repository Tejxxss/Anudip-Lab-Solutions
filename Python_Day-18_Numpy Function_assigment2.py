# 2.Suppose you have two sets of employee dataâ€”one containing information about full-time employees and another containing information about part-time employees. You want to combine this data to create a comprehensive employee dataset for HR analysis. 

# Input: # Employee data for full-time employees

#  full_time_employees = np.array([

#  [101, 'John Doe', 'Full-Time', 55000],

#  [102, 'Jane Smith', 'Full-Time', 60000], 

# [103, 'Mike Johnson', 'Full-Time', 52000] 

# ])

#  # Employee data for part-time employees :

# part_time_employees = np.array([ 

# [201, 'Alice Brown', 'Part-Time', 25000], 

# [202, 'Bob Wilson', 'Part-Time', 28000],

#  [203, 'Emily Davis', 'Part-Time', 22000]

#  ])


import numpy as np

# Employee data for full-time employees
full_time_employees = np.array([
    [101, 'John Doe', 'Full-Time', 55000],
    [102, 'Jane Smith', 'Full-Time', 60000],
    [103, 'Mike Johnson', 'Full-Time', 52000]
])

# Employee data for part-time employees
part_time_employees = np.array([
    [201, 'Alice Brown', 'Part-Time', 25000],
    [202, 'Bob Wilson', 'Part-Time', 28000],
    [203, 'Emily Davis', 'Part-Time', 22000]
])

# Concatenate the two arrays to combine full-time and part-time employee data
all_employees = np.concatenate((full_time_employees, part_time_employees), axis=0)

# Output the combined employee dataset
print("Combined Employee Dataset:")
print(all_employees)

# Output example:
# Combined Employee Dataset:
# [['101' 'John Doe' 'Full-Time' '55000']
#  ['102' 'Jane Smith' 'Full-Time' '60000']
#  ['103' 'Mike Johnson' 'Full-Time' '52000']
#  ['201' 'Alice Brown' 'Part-Time' '25000']
#  ['202' 'Bob Wilson' 'Part-Time' '28000']
#  ['203' 'Emily Davis' 'Part-Time' '22000']]
